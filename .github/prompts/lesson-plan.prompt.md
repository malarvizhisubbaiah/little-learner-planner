## Activity Mix Requirements

Each plan MUST include at least:
- 1 **Letter Sounds / Phonics** activity
- 1 **Counting / Maths** activity
- 1 **Storytime / Reading** activity
- 1 **Game** (I Spy, rhyming, scavenger hunt, etc.)

The remaining 2 activities can be from any category.

## Curriculum References

Use the progression guides in the `curriculum/` folder to select age-appropriate topics:
- `curriculum/reading.md` — Reading milestones and book suggestions
- `curriculum/phonics.md` — Phonics progression (letter sounds → blending)
- `curriculum/maths.md` — Maths concepts (counting → shapes → patterns → addition)

## Variation

If generating multiple days, ensure:
- Different letters each day (follow the phonics progression: S, A, T, P, I, N first)
- Different books / stories each day
- Different maths concepts rotating through counting, shapes, patterns, addition
- No repeated scenarios within a 5-day window
