# Maths Curriculum — Ages 3–4

## Milestones

By age 4, children should be working toward:
- Counting to 10 (and beyond with practice)
- Recognizing numerals 1–5
- Understanding "more" and "less"
- Sorting objects by color, size, or shape
- Recognizing basic shapes (circle, square, triangle, rectangle)
- Creating and recognizing simple patterns (ABAB)
- Basic concept of addition — "If I have 2 and get 1 more, how many?"

## Maths Progression

### Phase 1: Counting & Number Recognition (Weeks 1–4)
- **Rote counting** — Count to 5, then to 10
- **One-to-one correspondence** — Touch each object as you count
- **Number recognition** — Recognize numerals 1, 2, 3
- **Counting objects** — "How many apples are on the plate?"
- **Counting songs** — "Five Little Ducks", "Ten in the Bed"

### Phase 2: Shapes & Sorting (Weeks 5–8)
- **Basic shapes** — Circle, square, triangle, rectangle
- **Shape hunt** — Find shapes around the house (clock = circle, window = rectangle)
- **Sorting** — Sort by color, then by size, then by shape
- **Building** — Use blocks to build towers, talk about tall/short, big/small

### Phase 3: Patterns & Comparisons (Weeks 9–12)
- **Simple patterns** — Red, blue, red, blue — "What comes next?"
- **Size comparison** — Big/small, tall/short, long/short
- **More or less** — "Which group has more? Which has less?"
- **Ordering** — Line up toys from smallest to biggest

### Phase 4: Basic Addition & Subtraction Concepts (Weeks 13–16)
- **Adding with objects** — "You have 2 blocks. I give you 1 more. How many now?"
- **Taking away** — "You have 3 crackers. You eat 1. How many left?"
- **Number bonds to 5** — All the ways to make 5 (1+4, 2+3, etc.)
- **Story problems** — "3 ducks in the pond. 2 more swim over. How many ducks?"

### Phase 5: Numbers to 20 (Weeks 17–20)
- **Counting to 20** — Use a number line or hundred chart
- **Teen numbers** — Understand 11–19
- **Numeral writing** — Trace and write numbers 1–10
- **Measurement** — Use blocks to measure toys ("The car is 5 blocks long")

## Activity Ideas

1. **Snack Counting** — Count crackers, grapes, or berries before eating
2. **Block Towers** — "Build a tower with 4 blocks. Now add 2 more. How many?"
3. **Shape Collage** — Cut out shapes from paper, glue into a picture
4. **Pattern Necklace** — Thread colored beads or pasta in a pattern
5. **Number Hopscotch** — Draw numbers on the ground, hop and count
6. **Toy Lineup** — Sort toys by size, color, or type
7. **Finger Counting** — "Show me 3 fingers. Now show me 5!"
8. **Kitchen Maths** — Count spoons, measure cups of water, sort utensils
