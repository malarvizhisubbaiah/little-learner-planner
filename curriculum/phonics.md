# Phonics Curriculum — Ages 3–4

## Milestones

By age 4, children should be working toward:
- Recognizing that words are made up of sounds
- Identifying the first sound in a word
- Knowing 10–15 letter sounds
- Clapping syllables in words
- Recognizing rhyming words
- Attempting to "sound out" simple CVC words (cat, dog, sun)

## Phonics Progression

### Phase 1: Sound Awareness (Weeks 1–4)
- **Environmental sounds** — "What sound does a dog make? A car?"
- **Body percussion** — Clap, stamp, tap rhythms
- **Instrument sounds** — Shake, bang, ring (use pots, spoons, containers)
- **Rhythm and rhyme** — Nursery rhymes, rhyming books, silly rhymes

### Phase 2: Letter Sounds — Group 1 (Weeks 5–8)
Letters: **S, A, T, P, I, N**
- Introduce one letter sound every 2–3 days
- **S** — "Ssssss like a snake!"
- **A** — "A-a-a like an ant marching"
- **T** — "T-t-t like a ticking clock"
- **P** — "P-p-p like popping bubbles"
- **I** — "I-i-i like an itchy insect"
- **N** — "N-n-n like a noisy engine"

### Phase 3: Letter Sounds — Group 2 (Weeks 9–12)
Letters: **M, D, G, O, C, K**
- **M** — "Mmmmm like yummy food"
- **D** — "D-d-d like a drumbeat"
- **G** — "G-g-g like a gurgling baby"
- **O** — "O-o-o like an octopus"
- **C** — "C-c-c like a crunchy carrot"
- **K** — "K-k-k like a kicking kangaroo"

### Phase 4: Letter Sounds — Group 3 (Weeks 13–16)
Letters: **E, U, R, H, B, F, L**
- Continue same pattern: fun association + practice finding the sound in words

### Phase 5: Blending Introduction (Weeks 17–20)
- Start blending known sounds: S-A-T → SAT, P-I-N → PIN
- Use magnetic letters or letter cards
- "Robot talk" — Say words like a robot: "c-a-t" → child says "cat!"
- Sound buttons — Draw dots under each letter, press and say each sound

## Activity Ideas

1. **Sound Safari** — Walk around the house, find objects that start with today's letter
2. **Letter in Sand/Salt** — Trace the letter in a tray of sand, salt, or flour
3. **I Spy Sounds** — "I spy something that starts with 'sss'"
4. **Magnetic Letters** — Find today's letter among a pile of magnetic letters
5. **Sound Sorting** — Sort toys/objects into "starts with S" and "doesn't start with S" groups
6. **Action Sounds** — Jump for 'j', spin for 's', hop for 'h'
7. **Rhyme Time** — "Cat, bat, hat, mat — what else rhymes with cat?"
